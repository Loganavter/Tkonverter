# Project Vision

This document preserves the author's personal perspective on Tkonverter and has been moved out of the main README to keep it concise and user-oriented.

## My Personal View

The genesis of Tkonverter was a practical need that evolved through several stages. Initially, I needed a script to convert Telegram's HTML export format into plain text. At the time, I wasn't aware that Telegram could export chats directly as JSON.

When I discovered that Telegram actually supports JSON export, and realizing that a friend also needed a similar tool for chat preprocessing, I decided to develop my own comprehensive solution. This decision marked the transition from a simple conversion script to a full-featured desktop application designed for LLM preprocessing.

Today, I view Tkonverter as a valuable utility for anyone working with chat data and AI models. The core value lies in its ability to transform raw, unstructured chat exports into optimized input for LLMs. The application addresses two critical needs:

**Context Optimization**: By providing fine-grained control over what information is included in the final output, Tkonverter helps users maximize the utility of their LLM context windows. Whether you need to compress information to save tokens or enrich it with additional context, the tool provides the flexibility to achieve your goals.

**Data Visualization**: The interactive charting system transforms abstract message data into visual insights, making it easier to understand communication patterns and identify relevant time periods for analysis.

The development process, while challenging at times, has been incredibly rewarding. The most significant hurdle was the complete overhaul of the analysis system in October 2025, where I had to rebuild the tree-based data structures multiple times to achieve the desired performance and reliability. This iterative process, though time-consuming, resulted in a robust foundation that will serve the project well as it continues to evolve.

It's difficult to estimate the exact time invested in the project, but I would approximate it at around 80-120 hours in total, including the initial development, refactoring phases, and the major October update. The shared toolkit created during the unification with Improve-ImgSLI represents a significant investment in future development efficiency.

Looking ahead, I see Tkonverter as a specialized tool that fills a specific niche in the AI workflow ecosystem. While it may not have the broad appeal of general-purpose applications, it provides essential functionality for researchers, analysts, and developers working with chat data and language models.
