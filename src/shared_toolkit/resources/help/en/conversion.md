# Conversion Options

## Profiles

The profile affects how messages are formatted. In most cases, **Auto-detect profile** (in Settings) works best.

- **Group Chat:** Standard formatting for multi-user chats.
- **Personal Chat:** Formats the conversation from the perspective of "Me" and "Partner". You can set custom names for these roles.
- **Channel:** Simplified format suitable for channel posts.
- **Posts and Comments:** A special mode for channels where comments are enabled. It treats the first message as the main post and subsequent messages as replies.

## Key Options

- **Show reactions:** Includes message reactions (e.g., üëç 2).
- **Optimization:** A mode for channels that groups consecutive messages from the same author to save tokens.
