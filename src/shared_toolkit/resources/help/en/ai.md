# AI & Tokenizer Features

Tkonverter can calculate the exact number of tokens your chat will use with a specific AI model. This requires the **transformers** library.

- Click the **Download** icon to open the **Installation Manager**.
- From there, you can install the necessary libraries and download tokenizer models from Hugging Face.
- Once a tokenizer is loaded, the analysis will switch from counting characters to counting tokens.
